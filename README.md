# Implementation-of-the-Advanced-Encryption-Standard-AES
This code uses the pycryptodome library to implement the AES encryption algorithm in EAX mode, which provides both confidentiality and authenticity of the data. The aes_encrypt function takes the encryption key and message as input and returns the encrypted message. The aes_decrypt function takes the encryption key and encrypted message as input and returns the decrypted message.
